## awesome_answers.html
Using React as a client-side, I used AJAX to call on the JSON of another application known as Awesome Answers. The React side renders the questions and answers from the server-side originally built in a Rails framework.

## index.html
In this file, I used React as a playground to build a simple application that randomized 4 numbers in different color boxes, outputting the number into the center of the page. Each time a circle is selected the numbers are randomly shuffled again.
